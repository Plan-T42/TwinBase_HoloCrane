      instructions:
        1Start:
        - Welcome to HoloCrane World!
        - With this App, you can interact with the overhead crane at AIIC Lab!
        2Registration:
        - Firstly, let's register the space.
        - "Now, turn around and find the image with Time to REcalibration text on\
          \ the left upper of the coffee room door. \n Look closely at it until a\
          \ green bounding box appears and aligns to the image and looks stable. If\
          \ not aligned, try to walk around while looking at the image. \n You can\
          \ always come back and register the space again later."
        3Hologram:
        - Now more elements should join your view.
        - "Turn around to face the crane. You can find five yellow balls in space:\
          \ four Fixed Target and one Movable Target, with which you can move the\
          \ crane. Above the desk on your right, you can find  toggles to modify your\
          \ view. Once the guide is over, a dashboard with crane real-time status\
          \ will appear and follow your gaze. \n Above the desk on your right, you\
          \ can find  toggles to modify your view. \n Once the guide is over, a dashboard\
          \ with crane real-time status will appear and follow your gaze."
        4Operation:
        - Here is a quick guide on what you can do in this app.
        - "You can monitor crane's real-time status in the dashboard with: \n \n Crane\
          \ status: load, sway control, position, movement; \n Crane Target: name\
          \ and position of current selected target; \n Communication Staus: different\
          \ modules and watchdog value."
        4Operation1:
        - ''
        - "You can control the crane by interacting with target balls in two ways:\
          \ \n Click any of the four fixed targets to select; or \n Tap the movable\
          \ target and place it at a reachable spot. \n Once either way is done, the\
          \ control will start and crane will move to selected target. \n You can\
          \ reselct and change the target whenever you want."
        4Operation2:
        - ''
        - You can always make your view inoformative/clean as you like, by enable/disable
          different objects' visibility. To do this, switch the corresponding toggles
          on/off. Whenever you want, you can enable/disable the dashboard and target
          balls, and come back to this guide later.
